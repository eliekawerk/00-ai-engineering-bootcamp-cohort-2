I usually do not wear ear buds, favoring full-sized over-the-ear can, but sometimes ear buds are the right answer. I am not unhappy with these.<br /><br />There are two aspects of these that need discussion - the ANC function and the sound quality. I’ll cover each of these separately.<br /><br />The ANC function is good but is not top-notch. That is, it’s very effective at killing off ambient sound and it allows for listening to music at lower volumes without letting in surrounding sounds like fans and air handlers in an office or road noise in a car. It is not as aggressive as some of Sony’s other offerings, but still far and away better than cheaper headphones and ear buds available.<br /><br />I like the fact that I can touch one of the buds and the mode switches to allow more ambient noise through for conversation. This is a common feature for ANC phones of any type anymore, and this pair of buds implements this well.<br /><br />The default sound profile is good but not perfect. The bass is good and not overdriven which is a refreshing change from most phones I have used. The midrange is a little off, with sound being a little muddy and with the slightest of distortion if you’re looking for it. The highs are not sharp and also seem a bit muted like the midrange, though it is not severe enough to write these off by any means. I have worked with ear buds that have better balanced sound profiles, but I have also heard much worse. Now, all that said, with Sony’s application it’s easy to access an equalizer to better balance the sound as desired. I have had no trouble tweaking the active profile in the equalizer to get these to sound better depending on the kind of music I’m listening to.<br /><br />These are Sony’s midrange buds, and are sold at a midrange price point. If these were priced like their top-end buds I would be hesitant to recommend them. At the price point, though, they’re a good option and are better than most off-brand or cheap ear buds available.\",\n",
